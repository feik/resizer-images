            The maximum number of CAIR.exe instances to allow at the same time. After this limit is reached, 
            requests will wait until requests will MaxConcurrentWaitingThreads is reached, at which point 
            requests will be denied so the thread pool doesn't become exhausted.
            Set this value to at least CPU cores * 2, as the proccess is also I/O bound. Set to 0 for no limit (default).

            <summary>
            The maximum number of waiting threads (for a CAIR.exe instance) to permit before denying requests. Set to 0 (default) to permit an endless number of threads to wait (although request timeout will still be effect).
            Set this value to at least 30
